    <string name = "long_text">You will need to wrap the two scrollable views into a LinearLayout inside the ScrollView

        Below is a skeleton code version for this challenge.

        The important thing to remember is that since ScrollView can only have one child, you have to wrap that
        ImageView and the TextView into a LinearLayout.

        There is no solution code provided for this challenge, but the skeleton code below gives you the expected view
        hierarchy to use.
